Before investing in anything, DYOR (Do Your Own Research)


I wish I knew:

For example: I wish I joined Binance using a referral link with 5%, 10%, 15%, or 20% return on trading fees.
This referral code **II2C5M0T** or [referral link](https://www.binance.com/en/register?ref=II2C5M0T) is for 10% return on the trading fees, as the higher options of 15% and 20% can be generated by users that hold minimum 500 BNB.
